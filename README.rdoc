== RELATED PROJECTS

There are many projects that make gem development easier.
Hoe and Jeweler are the most popular; they generate the gemspec and tasks using
a configuration specified in the Rakefile, which is the opposite to what gemma
does. Mr Bones is a gem template generator that appears to be similar to Hoe
and Jeweler, but I haven't used it myself.

gemesis provides tasks for building, releasing and installing gems based on the
gemspec, but (at the time of writing) it doesn't provide tasks for tests and
documentation, etc.

rake-compiler provides support for compiling native extensions from a
gemspec, and it looks like it should work fairly well with gemma.
