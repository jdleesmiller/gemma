== DESCRIPTION

If you are using .gemspecs as intended
(http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/02/using-gemspecs-as-intended/), gemma generates
common rake tasks with default settings extracted from your .gemspec file.

== SYNOPSIS

To create a gem called +mygem+, first create +mygem.gemspec+ as
described in http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/02/using-gemspecs-as-intended/.

For more information about the gemspec, see the Gem::Specification Reference
(http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/20).

Then put the following at the top of your +Rakefile.rb+:
  begin
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'gemma'

    Gemma::RakeTasks.with_gemspec_file 'mygem.gemspec'
  rescue LoadError
    # Gemma is not installed; optionally, you can print a message:
    puts "Install gemma (sudo gem install gemma) for more rake tasks."
  end

This gives you a list of standard rake tasks with settings based on your
gemspec, in addition to any that you add yourself.

  rake clean         # Remove any temporary products.
  rake clobber       # Remove any generated file.
  rake clobber_rcov  # Remove rcov products for rcov
  rake clobber_rdoc  # Remove rdoc products
  rake rcov          # Analyze code coverage with tests
  rake rdoc          # Build the rdoc HTML Files
  rake rerdoc        # Force a rebuild of the RDOC files
  rake test          # Run tests
  rake yard          # Generate YARD Documentation

You can further customize the generated tasks by passing a block to
+with_gemspec_file+:

  Gemma::RakeTasks.with_gemspec_file 'mygem.gemspec' do |g|
    g.rdoc.title = 'My Gem Is Great'
  end

See the gemma API docs for more information.

== INSTALL

You should be able to install with

  gem install gemma

Alternatively, you can get the source with

  git clone git://github.com/jdleesmiller/gemma.git

and run

  gem build gemma.gemspec
  gem install gemma-<version>.gem

== RELATED PROJECTS

There are many projects that make gem development easier.
Hoe and Jeweler are the most popular; they generate the gemspec and tasks using
a configuration specified in the Rakefile, which is the opposite to what gemma
does. Mr Bones is a gem template generator that appears to be similar to Hoe
and Jeweler, but I haven't used it myself.

* http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/bones/ 

gemesis provides tasks for building, releasing and installing gems based on the
gemspec, but (at the time of writing) it doesn't provide tasks for tests and
documentation, etc.

rake-compiler provides support for compiling native extensions from a
gemspec, and it looks like it should work fairly well with gemma.
